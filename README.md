# The Quansistor in the Internet Computer Architecture

## Overview

This whitepaper introduces the quansistor as a fundamental computational primitive
embedded within the Internet Computer (IC) architecture.

The document explains how operator-based computation defined by Quansistor Field
Mathematics (QFM) can be instantiated, governed, and executed in a decentralized,
auditable environment using Internet Computer canisters.

This paper is architectural and conceptual, not mathematical.

## Purpose

- To explain how quansistors map to Internet Computer primitives
- To show how operator-based computation fits into canister-based execution
- To define the role of governance, auditability, and determinism
- To connect QFC theory with a real-world distributed platform

---

## Core Ideas

- Quansistors as persistent operator entities
- Canisters as execution containers for operator dynamics
- Deterministic execution with audit-native guarantees
- Integration with governance and policy enforcement
- Separation of computation, authorization, and execution

---

## What This Paper Is Not

- Not a mathematical formalization of QFM
- Not a performance benchmark
- Not a marketing document for ICP

---

## Position in the QFC Stack

This document serves as a **bridge** between:

- abstract QFC / QFM theory
- practical deployment on decentralized infrastructure

It motivates the need for the full QVM stack.

---

## Status

- Conceptual and architectural
- Platform-specific (Internet Computer)
- Non-conjectural
